# onos-cli
This is the implementation of a consolidated `onos` command-line interface for ONOS (ÂµONOS Architecture)

The goal is to provide a single CLI executable that can be used as a means to access CLI functionality
of a number of different ONOS subsystems, e.g. topo, config, control, ztp.

### Bash or Zsh Auto-Completion
The `onos` client supports shell auto-completion for its various
commands, sub-commands and flags. To enable this, run the following from the shell:
```bash
> eval "$(onos completion bash)"
```
After that, you should be able to use the `TAB` key to obtain suggestions for 
valid options.
